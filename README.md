# 🚀 IBM Data Science Capstone Project – SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

## 📌 Introduction

This capstone project, part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**, aims to predict whether the **Falcon 9 first stage** will land successfully.  
Successful landings allow **SpaceX** to reuse the rocket stage, reducing the cost of a launch to **$62 million**, compared to competitors who charge upwards of **$165 million**.

If a competing company can accurately predict the outcome of a Falcon 9 landing, it can make more competitive bids for satellite launches, potentially challenging SpaceX's market dominance.
